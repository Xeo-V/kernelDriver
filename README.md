# kernelDriver
This repository provides an intermediate-level Windows Kernel Driver in C++, demonstrating device-object creation, symbolic linking, and IRP handling, serving as a bridge for user-kernel communication.

# 🌟 Windows Kernel Driver Example 🌟

## 📚 Importance of Kernel Driver Development 📚

Kernel drivers operate at the system's core level and interact directly with hardware. Understanding kernel driver development offers priceless insights into the labyrinthine corridors of OS internals, hardware manipulation, and systems programming.

## 🛠️ How This Project Helps 🛠️

This project provides an intermediate-level example of a Windows kernel driver. It elucidates the arcane art of creating a device and a symbolic link, thereby illuminating the way for communication between user-mode applications and the kernel driver.

## ⚠️ Warning: Proceed with Caution ⚠️

Kernel drivers execute with the highest system privileges. A poorly implemented driver can unleash the dreaded Blue Screens of Death (BSOD), data loss, or even hardware calamities. For the love of all that is holy, test in a controlled sanctuary like a Virtual Machine (VM).

### 🤔 What's a VM? 🤔

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a digital doppelgänger of a computer system. It provides an isolated chamber to test potentially malevolent software without afflicting your beloved host machine.

### 🚀 Steps to Conjure a Windows VM 🚀

1. Download a VM potion like VirtualBox or VMware.
2. Install Windows in the VM as if raising a golem.
3. Conjure a kernel debugging link between the VM and your host sorcery machine.

### 🛠️ Project Setup 🛠️

1. Install Visual Studio and the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
2. Clone this repository as if summoning a familiar.
3. Build the project in Visual Studio like crafting a magic wand.

### 🌐 How to Use 🌐

1. Load the driver into the kernel realm using `sc create` and `sc start`.
2. Banish the driver using `sc stop` and `sc delete`.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack 🛠️

- C++ 🌌
- Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 🛠️

### 🎯 Future Goals 🎯

- [||||||||||-----] 60% Complete 🌓
- Add more IRP handlers like crafting spells.
- Implement communication with user-mode apps like a psychic medium.
